    "\n",
    "ChIP-Seq is the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with high-throughput sequencing (Seq) and can be used to identify DNA binding sites for transcription factors and other proteins. The goal of this hands-on session is to perform the basic steps of the analysis of ChIP-Seq data, as well as some downstream analysis. Throughout this practical we will try to identify potential transcription factor binding sites of PAX5 in human lymphoblastoid cells.\n",

    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you can expect to be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "  * generate an unspliced alignment by aligning raw sequencing data to the human genome using **[Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)**\n",
    "  * manipulate the SAM output in order to visualise the alignment in **[IGV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)**\n",
    "  * based on the aligned reads, find immuno-enriched areas using the peak caller **[MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS)**\n",
    "  * perform functional annotation and motif analysis on the predicted binding regions\n",
