    "It is often interesting to find out whether we can associate the identified binding sites with a sequence pattern or motif. To do so, we will identify the summit regions of the strongest PAX5 binding sites, retrieve the sequences associated with these regions, and use **[MEME](http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme)** for motif analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since many peak-finding tools merge overlapping areas of enrichment, the resulting peaks tend to be much wider than the actual binding sites. The summit and its vicinity are the best estimate for the true protein binding site, and so it is here where we look for repeated sequence patterns, called motifs, to which the transcription factor may\n",

    "Sub-dividing the enriched areas by accurately partitioning enriched loci into a finer-resolution set of individual binding sites, and fetching sequences from the summit region where binding motifs are most likely to appear enhances the quality of the motif analysis. Sub-peak summit sequences have already been called by MACS2 with the `--call-summits` option.\n",
