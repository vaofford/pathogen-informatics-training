    "[**MACS2**](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS) stands for **m**odel-based **a**nalysis of **C**hIP-**S**eq. It was designed for identifying transcription factor binding sites. MACS2 captures the influence of genome complexity to evaluate the significance of enriched ChIP regions, and improves the spatial resolution of binding sites through combining the information of both sequencing tag position and orientation. MACS2 can be easily used for ChIP-Seq data alone, or with a control sample to increase specificity."
