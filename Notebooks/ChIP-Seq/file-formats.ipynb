    "Over the years a set of commonly used file formats for genomic intervals have emerged. Most of these file formats are tabular where each row consists of an interval and columns have a pre-defined meaning, describing chromosomes, locations, scores, etc. The UCSC web browser has an informative list of these at [http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html).\n",

For example, the following BED feature represents a single base on chromosome 1; namely, the 1st base."
